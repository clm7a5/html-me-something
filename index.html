<p><b>Chaniya is 16 years old, in the 11th grade. She has been a USAG gymnast since she was 5 years old. She's been in the highest level of gymnastics since 
she was 12 years old. As a family, the Miller's have traveled across the country to attend competitions for Chaniya. She's won tons of medals and trophies 
along the way. Her goal is to receive a scholorship to compete at a division 1 university while pursing a medical degree. She wants to be an orthopaedic surgeon 
after finishing medical school. Chaniya created an Instagram page to display some of her best performances and trainings. College coaches often visit  
Instagram to find talented athletes. She gets excited every time a division 1 coach starts to "follow" her! </b><br>

<p><b>CJ is 10 years old, in the 5th grade. His favorite sport is basketball but he has played baseball and flag football as well. He has been playing 
basketball since the age of 4 years old. The highlight of his early basketball career was traveling to play in one of the biggest basketball tournaments, 
in Las Vegas, NV last year. He has also been recognized for being one of the top 20 players in his grade. He has dreams of playing basketball at 
Duke University or the University of Kansas. Like his big sister, he also wants to have a career in the medical field (after playing in the NBA)! He 
wants to be a surgeon or a physical therapist. Once Chaniya created an Instagram page to display her talents, CJ begged for us to create one for 
him to show his highlights! </b><br>

<h2><center>What Are Youth Sports Doing For Children?</center></h2>

<p id="main"> Some parents enjoy live music events, visiting museums, going to parks, relaxing at home while watching movies, etc. 
For the Miller family, our #1 hobby is watching all three of our children compete in competitive sports. Some say competitive
sports are pointless, a waste of money, too hard on kid's bodies and should only be played once children are in secondary school,
when their bodies are developed. Those people don't recognize the many advantages that comes along with being involved with youth sports. 
Being involved in sports, shows kids how to cooperate, how to handle winning and losing, and how to live healthy lives, all while gaining communication
and leadership skills. Also, starting competitive sports early on, will give kids more repititions to get better at their sports. Lets dive deeper into each benefit:
</p>

<p class="dark">
<b>Cooperation:</b> Being part of a team has taught the Miller kids how to give and take direction and how to provide and receive constructive criticism. 
Working with others to achieve a goal that they have in common is something that they will be doing for their entire lives. 
</p>

<p class="dark">
<b>Winning and Losing:</b> Playing competitive sports has given the Miller kids a taste of what's to come in life as they get older. We all experience wins 
and losses in life and it's important for children to know how to handle both. When they've won, it gave them confidence, joy, and showed them how hard 
work brings achievements. On the other hand, when they've experienced losses, it showed them that they need to prepare better, gave them additional goals to 
work towards, and showed them examples of people they can aspire to be like, when they faced others that are better than them. 
</p>

<p class="dark">
<b>Living Healthy Lives:</b> At an early age, the Miller kids realize the benefits of proper nutrition, rest, and exercise which are all needed for optimum 
performance in their sports. Learning about the benefits of living healthy lives while they're young will hopefully make it easy for them to continue 
these practices as they become adults. 
</p>

<p class="dark">
<b>Communication and Leadership Skills:</b> Unfortunately, some people grow up only socializing with people that look and talk like them. The Miller kids have 
been able to meet and interact with all different types of kids and adults. At an early age, they've learned important leadership skills such as being 
responsible. They've also learned that when they give maximum effort, they usually achieve great results. They realize that there will be no sports if they don't excel
in school.
</p>

<p id="main">
Ultimately, our kids are using sports as a secondary means to a free college education. All three make excellent grades in school which could also result
in a free college education experience. Chaniya is an honors student, currently with a 3.96 gpa. They all are hoping to be professional athletes. However, they 
all know the chances of making it to the pros for their individual sports are slim. They believe with hard work and dedication, they can be part of that slim group 
that gets to experience being a college and professional athlete. Both girls practice gymnastics over 20 hours per week. When CJ's not at basketball practice, he's 
participating in sports training and skill development. So, we're hardly ever at home except for Sunday evenings! They've experienced the highs and lows in sports. Chaniya has experienced broken bones and a surgery. She's 
persevered through it all and never gave up. Her siblings have seen her strive and get through it all, which has shown them that, to be one of the best and achieve 
goals, you will go through ups and downs. However, it will give them the experience needed as they pursue their dreams.
